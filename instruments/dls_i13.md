There are two I13 beamlines: 
[I13-I](https://www.diamond.ac.uk/Instruments/Imaging-and-Microscopy/I13/Coherence_branch.html) is the coherence branch and [I13-II](https://www.diamond.ac.uk/Instruments/Imaging-and-Microscopy/I13/Diamond-Manchester_Imaging_Branchline.html) is the Diamond Manchester Imaging beamline. Specifications bellow are for I13-II.
