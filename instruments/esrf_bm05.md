The Instrumentation Facility BM05 is a 2-pole wiggler beamline equipped with experimental stations to perform X-ray tomography, topography, diffraction, reflectometry and wavefront metrology. Beams of decimeter to micrometer sizes and energies from 6 keV to 150 keV are available for industrial use and for developing the instrumentation of the future.

The BM05 beamline is available for internal development and for proprietary research. It serves as a test and development station for X-ray optical elements and detectors, beam characterisation (coherence, polarisationâ€¦) and instrumentation R&D in general.
