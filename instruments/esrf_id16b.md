ID16B is a hard X-ray nanoprobe dedicated to 2D or 3D analysis of nano-scaled materials combining X-ray fluorescence (XRF), diffraction (XRD), absorption spectroscopy (XAS), excited optical luminescence (XEOL), X-ray beam induced current (XBIC) and phase contrast imaging. Low temperature, in-situ or in-operando sample environments can be accommodated.
