The X-ray Tomography Data Bank or TomoBank, provides a repository of experimental and 
simulated data sets with the aim to foster collaboration among computational scientists, 
beamline scientists and experimentalists, to accelerate the development of tomographic 
reconstruction and 3D visualization methods and to speed up their implementation in the 
various synchrotron facility data analysis software packages.
