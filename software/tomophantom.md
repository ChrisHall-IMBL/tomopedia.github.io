TomoPhantom is a toolbox to generate customisable 2D-4D phantoms (with a temporal capability) and their analytical tomographic projections for parallel-beam geometry. It can be used for testing various tomographic reconstruction methods, as well as for image processing methods, such as, denoising, deblurring, segmentation, and machine/deep learning tasks.


TomoPhantom is best-suited for testing various tomographic image reconstruction (TIR) methods. For TIR algorithms testing, the popular Shepp-Logan is not always a good choice due to its piecewise-constant nature. This toolbox provides a simple modular approach to efficiently build customisable 2D-4D phantoms consisting of piecewise-constant, piecewise-smooth, and smooth analytical objects as well as their analytical Radon transforms for parallel-beam scanning geometry.
